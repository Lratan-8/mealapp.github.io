This meal app is a project in to showcase my skills as a front end javascript developer.
This project was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.

We have been provided with an API that is connected to a database that has information of many food items.
We showcase those items in our website with their information.
We also store selected items in our favourites list that is saved in the local storage of our browser.
